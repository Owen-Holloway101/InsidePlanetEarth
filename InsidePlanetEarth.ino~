 * Controls the InsidePlanetEarth LED arrays
 * http://github.com/Owen-Holloway101/InsidePlanetEarth
 * 
 * Three states exist
 * Waiting:
     Ultrasonic sensors are active and will cause
     tranisition to Displaying state when triggered
   
 * Displaying:
     The LED's are being controlled (faded in and out) 
     This is controlled in a semi random fashion.
     
 * StaticDisplay:
     This state is triggered when the switch is set
     to high (on) all the lights stay on constantly
